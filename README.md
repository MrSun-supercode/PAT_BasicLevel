# PAT_BasicLevel
This Prpository i was updated synchronously when I brushed PAT Basic_Level. The original idea was to save the title I had done for easy reference.
Some of these questions have not passed some of the test points by myself, so I refer to the content of others'blogs.

And these codes are compiled and run through VS2017 IDE, just remove all comments from each project.
