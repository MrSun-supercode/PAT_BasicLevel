# PAT_BasicLevel
This Prpository i was updated synchronously when I brushed PAT Basic_Level. The original idea was to save the title I had done for easy reference.
Some of these questions have not passed some of the test points by myself, so I refer to the content of others'blogs.

And these codes are compiled and run through VS2017 IDE, just remove all comments from each project.

For each question, I copy the title and input and output first. If there are pictures or wrong format copies, I will put the title links below. Some ideas I wrote directly below the title, and some ideas were inserted in the code.
